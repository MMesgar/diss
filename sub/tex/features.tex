\chapter{Features}
\label{chapt:features}

In this chapter, we describe the features used in our approach. This chapter
builds upon Chapter \ref{chapt:method} where we focus on the core of
our approach, i.e.\ on how we model the interdependencies between the
tasks. These interdependencies account for the implications we derived
from our linguistic analysis (Chapter \ref{chapt:ling}). While Chapter
\ref{chapt:method} only provides the backbone and some template
predicates and formulas showing the general form of different formula
types, we now fill these templates with content. In Chapter
\ref{chapt:architecture}, we then explain our end-to-end concept
disambiguation and clustering system.

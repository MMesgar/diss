\chapter{Experiments}
\label{chapt:exp}

This chapter is devoted to the evaluation of the proposed concept
disambiguation and clustering approach. We compare the performance of
our system to the state of the art and also analyze the contribution
of its different parts to the overall performance. The latter allows
us to test our assumptions and their implementation and to draw
conclusions for future work.

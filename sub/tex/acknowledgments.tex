First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Michael Strube. 
It has been an honor for me to be a Ph.D. student of Michael. 
He is a true mentor, who has taught me how interesting research is done and presented. 
I appreciate all his contributions of time, ideas and motivations to make my Ph.D. experience productive and stimulating. 
Moreover, his patient and careful editing of my research papers has considerably improved my skills in scientific writing and presentation. 

I give my gratitude to Anette Frank, Katja Markert, and their team members for their beneficial comments and questions about my research in my presentations in Ph.D. colloquium series at Heidelberg University. 
I am eternally grateful to Katja Markert for agreeing to be the second reviewer of this thesis. 

Many thanks to the Klaus Tschira Foundation for financially supporting me by a Ph.D.\ scholarship during the time that I was conducting my research at Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS). 
I appreciate the German Research Foundation as part of Research Training Group “Adaptive Preparation of Information from Heterogeneous Sources” (AIPHES) for supporting me, as one of its associated research members, to travel to a conference in the U.S. for presenting one of the papers that is used in the research of this thesis.  

I want to express my heartfelt gratefulness to all HITS members for providing a very nice and inspiring environment. 
Particularly, I thank my colleagues in the natural language processing (NLP) group at HITS:
Angela Fahrni, Sebastian Martschat, Alex Juda, Benjamin Heinzerling, Nafise Moosavi and Christoph M{\"u}ller. 
People who were the first that listened to my research ideas and the last that read the my papers before submission. 

My sincere thanks also goes to Holger Gebert, one of the leaders of NLP projects at SAP Inc. in Germany, and Ashish Gard, the manager of Siri team at  Apple in U.S., who provided me an opportunity to join their team as intern, and gave me access to the laboratory and research facilities to deepen my knowledge in NLP and machine learning. 

Last but not least, I want to thank my family and friends, who have always been supportive. 
Particularly, my deepest thanks is for my spouse Shaghayegh Tavafi, for all of her lovely supports, in all easy and difficult moments.

\addchap*{Acknowledgments}

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Michael Strube. His door was (almost) always open. He introduced me to computational linguistics and coreference resolution, showed me how to do interesting research, and gave me the freedom and pushed me to follow my own ideas. Thank you, Michael, for undertaking the ``experiment''!

I am very grateful to Simone Paolo Ponzetto for agreeing to be the second reviewer of this thesis. I am indebted to Katja Markert for granting me the freedom to finish this thesis while already working in her group as a PostDoc.

Most work presented in this thesis was conducted while I was a PhD student at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS). I thank the Klaus Tschira Foundation for supporting me with a PhD scholarship during most of that time. I would like to thank the people at HITS for providing a very nice and inspiring environment. In particular, I thank my colleagues from the natural language processing group: I will always think fondly of the time I could spend with you! Most of all I miss the chats with Yufang Hou and the coffee breaks with Angela Fahrni or Alex Judea. Benjamin Heinzerling, Alex Judea, Mohsen Mesgar and Nafise Moosavi deserve a special thanks for proofreading this thesis.

Lastly, I want to thank my family and friends for always being supportive. In particular, I thank Svea and Leni, who are always there for me and brighten each of my days.
